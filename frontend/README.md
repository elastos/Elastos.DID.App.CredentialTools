# Elastos W3C DID Verifiable Credentials Toolbox

## Introduction

This web app provides services to Elastos developers who create or use Verifiable credentials.

Using this toolbox, developers can:

- **Create credential types** ("templates") that are later used by apps that generate credentials. Credentials have to be based on specific credential types that define their format.
- **Search existing credential types** to reuse them. For instance, before creating a new "avatar" credential type, in order to propagate reusability inside the DID ecosystem, all developers should rather use any existing "avatar credential type" previously defined by others instead of creating a new one.
- **Verify credentials** generated by apps in order to make sure that their application has generated valid credentials, for which all fields are defined by published credential types.
